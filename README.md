CO₂ Emission Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the CO₂ emissions of vehicles based on features like engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption. The goal is to provide an effective predictive model that can be used by automotive manufacturers, policymakers, and environmental organizations to understand and reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles.

Problem Statement
The automotive industry faces increasing pressure to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles. Accurate predictions of CO₂ emissions are crucial for designing vehicles that meet environmental standards. This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions based on vehicle characteristics, providing insights into how different factors like engine size and fuel consumption contribute to emissions.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

Data Collection: Data on vehicle features such as engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data to understand relationships between features and CO₂ emissions.
Feature Engineering: Preprocessing the data through scaling and selecting relevant features.
Modeling: Training and evaluating multiple regression models, including:
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Model Evaluation: Using evaluation metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² score to compare model performance.
Conclusion: Providing insights and potential improvements for future work.
Significance
This project aims to assist in the sustainability efforts of the automotive industry by providing tools to predict CO₂ emissions based on vehicle characteristics. By understanding and predicting CO₂ emissions, stakeholders can take data-driven steps to reduce their environmental footprint and comply with regulatory standards.

Key Results
Linear Regression achieved an R² score of 0.896, meaning it explained 89.6% of the variance in CO₂ emissions.
Ridge Regression performed similarly to Linear Regression but with slight improvements due to regularization.
Lasso Regression showed slightly worse performance compared to the other two models due to its feature selection approach.
Features Used
Engine Size
Cylinders
Fuel Consumption
Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squared errors. Lower MSE indicates better model performance.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average of the absolute errors, showing how close predictions are to actual values.
R² Score: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model. A higher R² value indicates a better fit.
Future Improvements
Feature Expansion: Add additional features like vehicle weight, type, and manufacturing year.
Model Selection: Test more advanced models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Apply more extensive hyperparameter optimization using techniques like grid search.
Cross-Validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation to improve model robustness.
